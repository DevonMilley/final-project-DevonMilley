# final-project

copy bot repo: https://github.com/NewsAppsUMD/dbk-copy-bot

My final project will be an extension of my copy bot, in which I will combine the copy notes Google Doc and the DBK Stylebook and turn it into a searchable website for staff members. I would like to keep the website pretty simple, so I think just a table might work for this. However, I'm still thinking of potential ways I could incorporate categories or filters to make the website prettier. One way I could create a page that's more than a table would be to have all the entries appear in alphabetical order with cateogry names as tags, so they can be filtered. For this, I would have to either come up with "titles" for entries on the copy notes Google Doc or put those in a separate page. Another example could be spomething like the AP stylebook website (https://www.apstylebook.com/), which only lists entries when you search for them. 

For this project, a unique record will be considered a stylebook entry that provides new information. the DBK stylebook already contians unique records, but I will need to clean the copy notes doc to ensure there are no duplicates. The schedule of updates would be an annual review by copy editors, managing editors and the equity committee every year while also allowing for immediate updates if something needs to be changed. Each entry would have a line that said when it was last updated. Edits outside of the annual update will come as they are needed. The annual update will happen all at once. There are no parts fo the data I would not display because nothing is sensitve information. It is all meant to be rules and tips to make DBK articles better.
